# ICIAR2018
BACH - ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on BreAst Cancer Histology images


## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- NVIDIA GPU (12G or 24G memory) + CUDA cuDNN

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org
- Install python scikit-learn libraries [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).
```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImagingLab/ICIAR2018
cd ICIAR2018
```

### Testing
- To test the model, run `test.py` script
- Use `--testset-path` comand-line argument to provide the path to the `test` folder.
```bash
python test.py --testset-path ./dataset/test 
```
- If you don't provide the test-set path, an open-file dialogbox will appear to select an image for test.
The test results will be printed on the screen.



### Dataset
- We use the ICIAR2018 dataset. To train a model on the full dataset, please download it from the [official website](https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/dataset/) (registration required).
After downloading, please put it under the `datasets` folder in the same way the sub-directories are provided.


### Training
- To train the model, run `train.py` script
```bash
python train.py
```
- To change the number of feature-maps generated by the patch-wise network use `--channels` argument:
```bash
python train.py --channels 64
```
